# Laptime-tracker

## Goal of this project
I often play racing games and I wanted to start tracking my laptimes accross different games and tracks.  
Many people use to store the data in spreadsheets, and so did I, but I got sick of it and created this application to make life easier.  

This Application makes use of PHP, Bootstrap, JQuery and the DataTable Plugin plus the Searchpanes extension.

## How to install
- `Download the laptime.sql file and import it to your MySQL/MariaDB`  
- `Change the DB information in the DBConnector.php script`  
- `Put the PHP Scripts on a server of your choice`  

## Features
- Adding different games, cars, tracks and even transmission types  
- Allows you to track your laptimes including the specified `parameters` (`parameters` -> games, cars, tracks, transmission type)
- Easily sorting and ordering the different datasets thanks to DataTables and Searchpanes  
- Creation date of the dataset, allowing you to easily track your personal lap improvement over time
