# Laptime
I often play racing games and I wanted to start tracking my laptimes accross different games and tracks.  
I used to store the data in Spreadsheets, but once I got sick of it I created this application.  

## How to install
- Download the laptime.sql file and import it to your MySQL/MariaDB  
- Change the DB information in the DBConnector.php script  
- Put the PHP Scripts on a server of your choice
